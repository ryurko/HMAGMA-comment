# Overview of data

This folder is meant to contain the files necessary for analysis, as well as 
store the results generated by the code. The following folders are assumed to exist:

- `reference_data` - containing folders `g1000_eur`, `pruned_genotype`, and `resampled_genotypes`,
- `simulations` - containing folders `null` and `nonnull`

The following datasets are __assumed to be in `reference_data` folder__ to start 
the analysis: (1) the 1000 Genomes reference dataset files `g1000_eur.fam`, `g1000_eur.bim`, `g1000_eur.bed` (available to download
[here](https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/MAGMA/ref_data/g1000_eur.zip)) and (2) the NCBI locations
of protein coding genes with build 37 (saved as `NCBI37.3/NCBI37.3.gene.loc` and available to download [here](https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/MAGMA/aux_files/NCBI37.3.zip))
